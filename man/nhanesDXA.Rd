\title{Import Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) data.}
\usage{
nhanesDXA(year, suppl = FALSE, destfile = NULL, adjust_timeout = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{The year of the data to import, where 1999<=year<=2006.}

\item{suppl}{If TRUE then retrieve the supplemental data (default=FALSE).}

\item{destfile}{The name of a destination file. If NULL then the data are imported 
into the R environment but no file is created.}

\item{adjust_timeout}{Typically a logical flag indicating whether
the default \code{\link{download.file}} timeout option should be
adjusted by taking into account the size of the file to be
downloaded, as reported by the server. The value can also be a
positive numeric value, in which case it is used as a further
multiplicative factor for the default calculation.}
}
\value{
By default the table is returned as a data frame. When downloading to file, the return argument
is the integer code from download.file where 0 means success and non-zero indicates failure to download.
}
\description{
DXA data were acquired from 1999-2006.
}
\details{
Provide destfile in order to write the data to file. If destfile is not provided then
the data will be imported into the R environment.
}
\examples{
\donttest{dxa_b <- nhanesDXA(2001)}
\donttest{dxa_c_s <- nhanesDXA(2003, suppl=TRUE)}
\dontrun{dxa = nhanesDXA(1999, destfile="dxx.xpt")}
